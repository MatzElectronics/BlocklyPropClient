BlocklyPropClient
=======================

Introduction
-----------------

The BlocklyPropClient is a Python client for the hosted version of BlocklyProp.
It loads your programs in to the Parallax Propeller and creates a serial connection from the browser to the propeller.

Running
-----------------

BlocklyPropClient has been written using Python 2.7 but packaged so it runs without having to install any dependencies.

The only requirement it has is that ftdi drivers are installed to allow serial connection over usb.
